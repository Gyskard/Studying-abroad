# studying-abroad - [Link](https://gyskard.alwaysdata.net/)

Tutored project of the second year of the university diploma of technology, in network and telecommunications, at [IUT 1](https://iut1.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) of the University of Grenobles-Alpes (France). The purpose of this project is to create a website to collect testimonies from students of the IUT who went to study abroad or from foreign students who came to the IUT. 

## Description

The website is divided into two parts.

### The public website

The public website is composed of an interactive map where each testimony is represented by a marker, when you click on it the student's testimony is displayed in a popup.

### The testimonial manager

As its name suggests, it allows you to manage the different testimonies added to the website, it interacts with JSON files to store the testimonies and with a MySQL database for authentication.
